        Be aware of the difference between default and named exports. It is a
        common source of mistakes. We suggest that you stick to using default
        imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for
        example, a component). Thatâ€™s what you get when you use export default
        Button and import Button from './Button'. Named exports are useful for
        utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most
        one default export and as many named exports as you like.
